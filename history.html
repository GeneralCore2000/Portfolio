                        <div class="firstHistory">
                            <p>From a young age, I was exposed to computers and the vast realm of the internet, which ignited my curiosity about their inner workings. Although I only pondered about it initially, my fascination grew and I began wondering about the intricacies of website development. This curiosity led me to discover three fundamental languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Motivated, I even attempted to create my own website, but unsurprisingly, my interest waned quickly, and I abandoned the endeavor.</p>

                            <p>
                                During my high school years, I had the good fortune of befriending individuals who shared my passion for coding. While they dabbled in languages such as C#, C++, and Python without expertise, I found solace in the companionship of someone who shared my interests. However, this camaraderie alone did not solidify my determination to pursue programming.

                            <p>
                                It was during my senior year of high school that my interest truly blossomed. Under the guidance of a dedicated teacher, I delved into the realm of Java programming, experiencing a mixture of joy, frustration, and admiration for this hobby.
